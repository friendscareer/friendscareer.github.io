Joyeuse Senga graduated from Samford University with a double major in Public Health and Health Sciences. Joyeuse merges her interests in medicine and public health to focus her efforts on understanding the social determinants of health globally, paying close attention to Sub-Saharan Africa. She has worked in various research roles in public health in Rwanda and the United States. She has also spearheaded initiatives to increase literacy rates in Rwanda by encouraging the proliferation of Rwandan-authored stories, especially of those written in the local language - Kinyarwanda. With her education, she pushes for an all-encompassing environment that transcends controlled scientific environments to better understand the most effective ways of improving lives.
