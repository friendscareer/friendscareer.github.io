Our career mentors empower you to pursue your calling and inspire learning. Our mentors are college graduates and young professionals passionate about working with young people. At the Friends Career Center, we match you with a mentor for a one-on-one mentorship. The mentor helps you learn about yourself and guides you through understanding your calling. We provide both mentors and mentees with strategies and tools that build an honest and transformative relationship.
